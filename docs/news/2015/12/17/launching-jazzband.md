summary: We are all part of the band. Jazzband is a cooperative experiment to
         reduce the stress of maintaining Open Source software projects.

### We are all part of the band.

[Jazzband](https://jazzband.co/) is a cooperative experiment to reduce the
stress of maintaining Open Source software projects. It aims at lowering the
barrier of entrance for people willing to step up as maintainers and grants
access to GitHub repositories hosted under the
[Jazzband GitHub organization](https://github.com/jazzband) to everyone who
joins. It’s supposed to simplify the process of managing a volunteer project
for the original author(s) and makes stepping away easier.

Its purpose can most easily be characterized as _“relief”_:

- Relief from the _exhausting parts_ of being a maintainer — either of
  big or small software projects, widely used or only written for one task.

- Relief of _not knowing_ how to get a fix landed or a feature added as a user.

It normalizes the relationship between creators and consumers, between
“core committers” and “end users”.

There are a few [guidelines](/about/guidelines) to follow before deciding to
transfer existing projects to the Jazzband or creating a new one like agreeing
to the Jazzband’s [code of conduct](/about/conduct).

Some optional [features](/about/releases) should also be considered to be used by
the Jazzband [projects](/projects) to further improve the contribution workflow.

I guess some band [members](/members) will want to take the lead singer role,
but you know how it is not everyone is great at everything so let’s support them
and enjoy the diversity – there is more to a band than its lead singer.

Assume positive intent when playing together in the band, but don’t hesitate
to call out naysayers. Fix conflicts and differences of ideas by discussion
and finding compromises. In other words: _Play together._

My role will be the “roadie who also happens to play the guitar sometimes” –
I’ll stay in the background and let the band members do their thing. See the
Jazzband [roadies](/roadies) page for others that have that role.

Sadly nothing of Jazzband will make financing Open Source software development
easier – it's currently out of scope of Jazzband. And I guess the music
industry is a bad analogy to figure that out anyway.

But hey, at least you shouldn’t feel bad about moving on to your next “band” or
“gig” only because you think you owe it to your “fans” to stick around. The
Jazzband will have your back, just [join](https://jazzband.co/) and let's see
where it brings us.

Anyways, that’s all for now. Please feel free to learn more
[about Jazzband](/about) and the see [FAQ](https://jazzband.co/about/faq)
in case you have more questions.

**We are all part of the band.**
