title: Security Policy
navigation: Security

In case you have found a security issue with ANY Jazzband project
please **do NOT open public GitHub issues, pull requests or anything
else that could leak sensitive information to the public**.

Jazzband asks you to instead responsibly report the security issue
by email to [security@jazzband.co](mailto:security@jazzband.co).

Your email is sent to the Jazzband roadies, the people that maintain
the Jazzband organization. A member of the roadies will respond to
you acknowledging your initial email and then, depending on the
action to be taken, further followup emails afterwards.

If you would like to optionally encrypt the email to [security@jazzband.co]sec(mailto:security@jazzband.co)
please use the PGP key with the fingerprint:

```
02DE 8F84 2900 411A DD70  B137 4D87 558A F652 A00F
```

The key's short ID is `F652A00F` and can be fetched from many public
key servers.
