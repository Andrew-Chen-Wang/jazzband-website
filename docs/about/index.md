title: About

Here you’ll find some background info, a quick introduction how
Jazzband works and some examples how to improve maintenance of
your own projects using Jazzband’s techniques.

### Introduction

Jazzband was born out of the stress of maintaining an Open Source project
alone for a longer time. As such it's aimed at projects with only a
few maintainers that have not achieved creating a community of maintainers
yet.

Jazzband strives to enable broader collaboration between the users by
bringing down the walls that prevent them from becoming contributors.

Jazzband tries to foster participation by the community and shared
responsibilty within its membership. It helps keeping projects alive as
well as finding new avenues of development.

In short, it's cooperative coding.

### Joining

When you join you will be...

- automatically added to the Jazzband GitHub organization
- granted a wide range of privileges, e.g. pushing to repositories

After that you can go ahead and do things like...

- move repos that follow the [guidelines](/about/guidelines) into the Jazzband organization
- start working on an already existing Jazzband [project](/projects)
- do [[releases]] on PyPI automatically via Travis CI

You can [login here](/account/login) to join Jazzband.

### Conduct

The Jazzband follows a [code of conduct](/about/conduct) which includes
respecting the opinions and previously made technical and communal decisions
of project maintainers. We assume positive intent but be clear that we won't
accept bullies and old farts that just want to push their ideas. Collaboration
is key and compromises required in a Jazzband.

### Support

Jazzband is graciously supported by
[BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) (browser and device testing).
