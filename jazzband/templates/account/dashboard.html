      To become an active member <a href="{{ url_for('account.join') }}">please join</a>

    We fetched some data about you from the
    <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API</a> to be able to
    display the <a href="{{ url_for('members.index') }}">members list</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example your GitHub login is <b>{{ current_user.login }}</b>,
    your GitHub account can be found <a href="{{ current_user.html_url }}">here</a>
    and your Avatar image <a href="{{ current_user.avatar_url }}">here</a>.

    {% if current_user.projects_memberships.scalar() %}
    The project(s) you're a member of. If you are a project lead
    in one of them you can do releases to PyPI as well.

    If not, that's okay, you're still part of the band.

  <h4>Email addresses</h4>
  <p>
    The email addresses that we fetched using the GitHub API to make sure
    there is at least one verified:
    <ul>
    {% for email in current_user.email_addresses.all() %}
      <li>{{ email.email }}{% if email.primary %} (primary){% endif %}</li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>

  <h4>What's next?</h4>
  <p>
    You may be wondering what you can do as member of the Jazzband.
    And that's a fair question since this site doesn't provide much
    specific work to do by itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    All code work happens in our
    <a href="https://github.com/jazzband">GitHub organization</a>. Feel free
    to head over there to see a list of projects, or see the same data on the
    <a href="{{ url_for('projects.index') }}">project index</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may also find the <a href="{{ url_for('members.index') }}">member list</a>
    useful to start contributing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't miss the <a href="{{ url_for('content.about', path='faq') }}">FAQ</a>
    and <a href="{{ url_for('content.about', path='contact') }}">reach out</a>
    to fellow Jazzband members if needed.
  </p>
  <h4>Other things to do here</h4>
  <p>
  {% if current_user.is_member %}
    Do you want to <a href="{{ url_for('.leave') }}">leave</a> the Jazzband?
  {% else %}
    Do you want to <a href="{{ url_for('.join') }}">join again</a>?
  {% endif %}
    Or simply <a href="{{ url_for('.logout') }}">logout</a>?
